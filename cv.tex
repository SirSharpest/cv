\section{Personal Statement}
I am an extremely driven and motivated student, in all things; I make it my goal everyday to improve upon the last. With a true thirst for knowledge and desire for understanding it is my long-term goal to pursue a career into academia. \\
\\
Discovering new and interesting problems, discussing them with others, and progressing to solutions is what propels me towards science.
I believe that computer science is an excellent tool that can be used to great effects in the field of biology in particular.

\section{Self-driven Projects}

\begin{tabular}{r|p{11cm}}

  Biology of the cell course & Having fallen in love with biology whilst studying computer science at university, I have started a small project to make a openly available crash-course style of notes for anyone from a non-biology background. I contribute to it quite regularly and plan to complete full series of biology information (\href{https://github.com/SirSharpest/Bio-Cramming}{https://github.com/SirSharpest/Bio-Cramming})\\
  \\
  Python blackboard scrapper& I decided to teach myself python and as I know I am a practical learner I jumped right in and aimed to write a practical application. The application I developed enables university students to download all of their lecture slides and information just by entering their username and password.(\href{https://github.com/sirsharpest/blackboard\_crawler}{https://github.com/sirsharpest/blackboard\_crawler})\\
  \\
  Image Analysis Software& As a side project I have started building a Rubik's cube solver which uses OpenCV and AStar IDS to provide instructions for a user to complete a cube puzzle. This is in early stages but progress can be seen at my GitHub which is updated regularly (\href{https://github.com/SirSharpest/Rubkis-Cube-Solver}{https://github.com/SirSharpest/Rubkis-Cube-Solver})
