  &Aberystwyth University - BSc Computer Science\\\textsc{Sept 14 - June 2018 \  }&\footnotesize{I am currently in my third year at university and have made an effort to focus on computer vision and data analysis and have taken additional modules in statistics for biology. I am hoping to complete my degree with 1st class honours}
 \end{tabular}

\section{Research Experience}
My experience has been primarily focused on genomic and phenotypic research in plant \\science. Specifically computer vision analysis and QTL mapping of seed and grain traits. Additionally I have designed and built automated systems specifically for gathering and generating gravimetric data.

\section{Self-driven Projects}

\begin{tabular}{r|p{11cm}}

  Biology of the cell course & Having fallen in love with biology whilst studying computer science at university, I have started a small project to make a openly available crash-course style of notes for anyone from a non-biology background. I contribute to it quite regularly and plan to complete full series of biology information (\href{https://github.com/SirSharpest/Bio-Cramming}{https://github.com/SirSharpest/Bio-Cramming})\\
  \\
  Python blackboard crawler&  The application I developed enables university students to download all of their lecture slides and information just by entering their username and password.(\href{https://github.com/sirsharpest/blackboard\_crawler}{https://github.com/sirsharpest/blackboard\_crawler})\\
  \\
  Image analysis software& As a side project I have started building a Rubik's cube solver which uses OpenCV and AStar IDS to provide instructions for a user to complete a cube puzzle. This is in early stages but progress can be seen at my GitHub which is updated regularly (\href{https://github.com/SirSharpest/Rubkis-Cube-Solver}{https://github.com/SirSharpest/Rubkis-Cube-Solver})

  &Doonan Lab - Bioinformatician \\\textsc{September 2017 - Current}
  &\footnotesize{Whilst studying, I work part time for the John Doonan lab at Aberystwth University. In this role I analyse and prepare large datasets for publication. Typically I work in crop traits and genetics. This involves a lot of collaboration and interaction with different research groups around the world}\\\multicolumn{2}{c}{} \\

  &National Plant Phenomics Center - Image Analyst / Systems Developer \\\textsc{May 2016 - August 2017}
  &\footnotesize{
    My role at the NPPC was extremely varied. I have worked on building and redesigning a Gravimetrics system for plant phenotyping and data generation. 
    My favourite role has been in creating image analysis algorithms, used to generate and process data gathered from various systems that the center uses.
    A large part of my time was devoted to data analysis and statistical evaluation of phenotypic data.}\\\multicolumn{2}{c}{} \\
